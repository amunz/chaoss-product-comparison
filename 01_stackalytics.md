The Stackalytics (OpenStack Analytics) site was developed my the Mirantis corporation in 2013 to provide OpenStack with an analytics tool that collects code contributions data, vendor drivers information, and a community members directory. As [defined by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/stackalytics-com-whos-growing-the-openstack-pie/), _"Stackalytics is a data visualization tool that collects data from GitHub and presents it in an array of useful forms."_

### Metrics

From the Stackalytics site, a number of key metrics are collected from the code contributions made by the OpenStack community. They include:

* Commits
* Completed Blueprints
* Drafted Blueprints
* Emails
* Filed Bugs
* Lines of Code
* Patch Sets
* Person-day effort
* Resolved Bugs
* Reviews
* Translations

#### Commits
**Commits** are defined as code contributions that have

#### Completed Blueprints
**Completed Blueprints** show blueprints that have been completed and lists the person made an effort to deliver the blueprint into upstream code.

#### Drafted Blueprints
**Drafted Blueprints** show all blueprints in LaunchPad, and lists the original author of each blueprint.

#### Emails

#### Filed Bugs
**Filed Bugs** are

#### Lines of Code
**Lines of Code** (as a metric) are

#### Patch Sets
**Patch Sets** are

#### Person-day effort
**Person-day effort** is metric determined by

#### Resolved Bugs

#### Reviews
**Reviews** are defined as

#### Translations

### Contribution Filters

The data provided by each of these metrics can be filtered in a number of ways. They are as follows:

* Release
* Project Type
* Module
* Company
* Contributor

#### Release
The **Release** filter allows the metrics to be filtered by the official OpenStack releases. At the time of this writing, the current releases available to be filtered by are:
  * Austin
  * Bexar
  * Cactus
  * Diablo
  * Essex
  * Folsom
  * Grizzly
  * Havana
  * Icehouse
  * Juno
  * Kilo
  * Liberty
  * Mitaka
  * Newton
  * Ocata
  * Pike
  * Queens

#### Project Type
The **Project Type** filter allows the contribution metrics to be filtered by project type. At the time of this writing, there are two parent-project types:

  * **OpenStack** projects are projects that are defined by the OpenStack Governance committee, which include two project subtypes:
    * Official
    * TC-approved
    * Others - projects that are **not** included in any OpenStack program.

  * **Complimentary** indicates projects that are part of the OpenStack ecosystem, which includes 9 project subtypes:
    * Ansible
    * Ceph
    * Cloud Foundry
    * Docker
    * Kubernetes
    * OPNFV
    * OpenShift
    * Open vSwitch
    * Python Packaging

#### Module
The **Module** filter allows the contribution metrics to be filtered by repositories, official projects, or pre-configured groups of modules.  This list of modules is quite large, but some of them include:
  * Barbican Official
  * Blazar Official
  * Ceilometer Official
  * Chef Openstack Official
  * Cinder Official
  * Cloudkitty Official
  * Congress Official
  * Cyborg Official
  * Designate Official
  * Documentation Official
  * Glance Official
  * Heat Official
  * Horizon Official
  * I18N Official
  * Infrastructure
  * anchor
  * ansible-hardening
  * ansible-role-k8s-cookiecutter
  * bifrost
  * bindep
  * ciwatch

#### Company
The **Company** filter allows the contribution metrics to be filtered by contributors based on their company affiliation.

#### Contributor
The **Contributor** filter allows the contribution metrics to be filtered by the name of the contributor as configured in Launchpad.
