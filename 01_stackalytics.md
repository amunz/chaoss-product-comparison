The Stackalytics (OpenStack Analytics) site was developed my the Mirantis corporation in 2013 to provide OpenStack with an analytics tool that collects code contributions data, vendor drivers information, and a community members directory. As [defined by Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/stackalytics-com-whos-growing-the-openstack-pie/), _"Stackalytics is a data visualization tool that collects data from GitHub and presents it in an array of useful forms."_
