### Metrics

From the Kibble UI, a number of key metrics are collected. They include:
* Commit Authors
* Number of commits
* Number of lines changed
* Number of committers 
* Percent of each of programming language
* Percent of code
* Percent of comments
* Percent of blanks
* Top 5 contributors
* Number of commits by an author
* Number of deletions by an author
* Number of insertions by an author

#### Commit Authors
The commit authors indicate the amount of users who committed to the project. A percentage is provided to show an increase or decrease for the number authors based on previous data. 

#### Number of commits
